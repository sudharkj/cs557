## Noisy Elliptical Dots

An attempt was made to create a noisy elliptical dots. 
The sphere changes with changes to the following parameters.

* uAd and uBd: diameter of the ellipse
* uNoiseAmp: amplitude of the noise
* uNoiseFreq: frequency of the noise
* uTol: accepted tolerance when showing the ellipse
* uAlpha: transparency
* ChromaDepth: change in color as the depth in the image change
