## The Rat Menagerie

A successful attempt to simulate disco lighted animation in slow motion on a cartoonized rat. 
I attempted to make some random animations and observed that the (s, t) coordinates somehow map different parts of the rat. 
So, changing color based on (s, t) coordinates added distinguishable colors to different parts of the rat. 
The related code seemed very short and so I included lighting and observed that changing the shininess made the rat look more like a cartoon.
